        <h3 style="text-align: center">Mockup 1: List of Users</h3>
        <embed src="Mockups\Volunteer.US - Mockup 1.png" length="1366" width="768" style="align-self: center">
        <p>
            This images was meant to tackle the story: "As a staff member or authorized user, 
            I need a list of users to manage." The placeholder text below the "Volunteer List" header 
            explains what was intended for the individual page. The top bar has five categories--one which
            links to the homepage, one which provides links for volunteers (or potential volunteers),
            one which gives links for organizations (or those potentially interested in proposing volunteering 
            opportunities), one which supplies links for other resources related to the Volunteer U.S. website,
            and one which speaks about the Volunteer U.S. group itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Questions that came up during the development of this page include:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    What other tabs or links would be useful to handle the varied users that might 
                    access this website?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What other information would staff members find useful at a glance on the list 
                    of volunteers? In other words, given the five options and fields already present,
                    what would beneficially add to what has already been given?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Would it be useful for banned users to still appear on user lists? Or would that
                    not be a concern of staff members when they are looking at such lists?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>While the current mockup has its merits, tweaks I would make include spreading out some 
            of the content such that it does not feel so crowded. I was attempting to structure the 
            page such that the features could fit on one mockup such that both of my mockups could be 
            about something distinct, but this caused some of the features to feel slightly cramped. 
            Similarly, I would tweak some of the colors such that the text was clearer. I am certainly
            not well-versed in color theory, but I made an attempt not to make the page an eyesore.
        </p> 
        <p>
            (Given the lack of context for the name and aesthetic features, however, I am the most proud of the name;
            if the website is meant for some community in the United States, then the website is a fitting 
            pun and is very memorable as a URL.)

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Mockup 2: Tracking with Guardians</h3>
        <embed src="Mockups\Volunteer.US - Mockup 2.png" length="1366" width="768" style="align-self: center">
        <p>
            This page is meant to handle the story: "As a user, I need to track guardians to minors, 
            so that minors always participate with a guardian." However, as I was working on this mockup,
            my idea of what it might represent expanded and was generalized into something more like "as a staff member, 
            I need to track guardians to wards, so that wards always participate with a guardian." While we discussed 
            the idea that minors should be tracked and linked to guardians, we did not specify how exactly that 
            should be done nor if there are any other groups who would benefit from a similar linked relationship. 
            There may be other parties that could help in volunteering but require assistance in some form. As such,
            the Volunteer U.S. website could manage that through the same account linking system if it was generalized 
            to manage different sorts of linkage. In a sense, this page does represent exactly the story that 
            was initially represented by us in class, but I have used less specific terms to describe it in case 
            more could be added to this individual user story. On the other hand, I have specified a staff member's 
            involvement because I am not sure about what is necessary to prove guardianship and figured that 
            some sort of staff verification could be one avenue for that. 
        </p>

            Questions that came up during the development of this page include:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Would there be other relationships that the account linking would be useful to cover?
                    An example might be with those who have trouble getting around by themselves or may have 
                    some kind of disability and may need assistance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If there are other groups that need linked accounts and assistance, should there be 
                    more categorizations to handle permissions on users' accounts?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What kind of verification should be performed to assure that the link between two 
                    accounts is valid? That is, how much should the Volunteer U.S. group look into 
                    guardian-ward relationships such that proper guardianship is established?
                    Should a staff member be involved in allowing for the verification, as the 
                    current mockup supposes? Or should there be a simpler route?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In opposition to the first mockup, I felt that this mockup was a little bare. However, I did enjoy 
            trying to apply an interesting visual effect with the left and right sides below the bar of buttons.
