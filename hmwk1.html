        Colleges, as institutions, are (or, at least, are <i>supposed</i> to 
        be) dedicated to learning. Students take many a rigorous course with
        the aim of becoming proficient at some desirable skillset. After that,
        the envisioned ideal is for us to ship ourselves off into a career 
        suited to our trained and tested repertoire. But this view of the 
        development of fledgling adults into adept professionals is entirely too
        shortsighted, static, and simplistic. David Thomas and Andrew Hunt's 
        <cite src="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-pragmatic-programmer/020161622X/">The Pragmatic Programmer</cite> 
        is very aware of this and seeks to curb that myopic perspective such that 
        programmers do not stifle their own potential through arrogance, laziness, or
        ignorance.

        As a second-semester senior at Xavier University, I have only one slew of
        classes to get through before I bid this wonderful place farewell. Such a 
        realization is both exciting and saddening, but the question of what I shall 
        do after my formal schooling is officially over has consistently haunted me. 
        Graduate school is an attractive option, but I had very little time to think 
        about applying with two theses over my head in the fall semester. As such, a 
        year-long gap stands between me and my quest for some of the highest education 
        that I could possibly attain. On top of this, there are certain subjects that 
        I have not tackled yet that a person interested in the fields of 
        <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> and 
        <abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr> would benefit 
        from knowing in advance (i.e. multivariable calculus or 
        probability theory). So, I have frequently considered the prospect of 
        self-driven education. The obstacle looming before me, however, is how 
        exactly I would tackle that self-guided learning such that I would not lose 
        motivation and I would actually achieve some aptitude in my chosen areas of study.

        In relation to my personal pursuits, Hunt and Thomas are helpful both in 
        reinforcing my perspective that I should always learn as much as I can
        throughout my life and in providing practical methodologies toward actually 
        providing myself with the learning that I desire. The tried-and-true fiscal 
        metaphor of the "knowledge portfolio" drives their point home in many ways, as our
        post-graduation education could lend itself to a higher payout while we do
        business with businesses. However, the tip that struck me the most was
        that <quote cite="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-pragmatic-programmer/020161622X/">[l]earning 
            an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be 
            just as hard as finding an undervalued stock, but the payoff can be just 
            as rewarding</quote> (Thomas and Hunt "Your Knowledge Portfolio"). While I am not a risk-taker, 
        making advances in my own education by my own curiosity and sensibility seems to be 
        beneficial whether what I gained from the process became profitable or not.
        Furthermore, as long as I can rationalize my independent training under the 
        continued improvement of general skills, I see little reason not to branch
        out and to try to cultivate my own versatility and expertise. There are many
        methods to experiment with (i.e. learning new programming languages, using new 
        environments, subscribing to journals, trade magazines, or periodicals, 
        or meeting with local user groups), so I am not bereft of doable options, either.
        Indeed, despite not being at an institution devoted to education soon enough, I 
        still have a plethora of reasons and of options in advancing my own prowess.
